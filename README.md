# Dotfiles for Pop!_OS

Minimal i3 setup combining functionality and simplicity. Requires `i3`, `i3lock-color`, `rofi`, `flameshot`, `playerctl`, and `nitrogen`. Change variables (city, Codeforces username, etc.) in the `.sh` scripts under `~/.config/i3blocks/scripts`. Includes wallpaper for lock screen and desktop (1920Ã—1200) and runs **kotofetch** on terminal start. Copy dotfiles to your home directory, install dependencies, adjust variables, start i3, and enjoy.
